There was a bug in the **Additional Discount** functionality of ERPNext in **v15.64.0**. This has since been fixed.

**If you've updated from a version older than v15.64.0, no action is needed on your side.**

If you're updating from v15.64.0, the **Additional Discount Amount** in some transactions may differ from the value you entered. This only affects cases where **Additional Discount Amount** is manually entered. If it is computed from **Additional Discount Percentage** entered by you, there shouldn't be any issue.

This report can help identify such transactions: [Calculated Discount Mismatch](/app/query-report/Calculated%20Discount%20Mismatch)

Please review and amend these as necessary.

We apologize for the inconvenience caused.
